    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook a user behavior analysis will be performed on the user data of a fashion e-commerce company, the data represents the inactivity of registered users.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this notebook, you will find related information about the company, the problem description and information about the used data. Next, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis using Python and Pandas. Following this, by using a local MySQL installation and a MySQL Python Connector, a database is created, and the relevant data is uploaded for storage. Then, using SQL queries the data is extracted and saved on a CSV file for analysis. Finally, the data is analyzed, and insights are extracted using Tableau."

Users can also be divided in two segments: buyers and sellers, both type of users show signs of exponential disinterest after a couple of days, this could be happening due to several reasons: \n",

    "- New Marketing campaigns attracted new users; the inactivity could represent a lack of interest.\n",

    "Buyers represent most of the population in both short- and long-term categories. Short term and long-term users can be predicted by using certain indicators, for buyers the indicators are products liked, products wished, and products bought; for sellers the indicators are products liked, followers and pass rate. By performing a deeper analysis on the buyers indicators, the following insights and recommendations about the buyers were produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The most optimal marketing strategy in order to improve the products liked indicator involves attracting female users that live in Denmark and that uses iOS devices.\n",

    "3. In order to generate more sales, the most optimal marketing strategy involves attracting male and female user interaction through iOS and android app, the campaign should be focused on Deutschland and Sweden.\n",
    "4. Design and apply a marketing campaign that focuses on men.\n",
